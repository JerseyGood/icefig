{"name":"Fig","tagline":"Java lambda supplement","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nJava 8 delivered lambda expressions, but without the enhancement of basic libraries like List, Map, String, which makes\r\nlambda expression still not delightful.\r\n\r\nBorrowered from Ruby basic library, Fig intends to supply the missing.\r\n\r\n## Quick Scan\r\n\r\n```java\r\nSeq<Integer> seq = Seq.of(1,2,3);\r\nseq.shuffle(); // copy to a new seq and shuffle it\r\nseq.shuffle$(); // shuffle the original seq\r\nseq.forEachWithIndex((value, idx) -> {\r\n    // (1, 0)  (2, 1)  (3, 2)\r\n});\r\nseq.forEachCons(2, (values)->{\r\n    // [1,2]  [2, 3]\r\n});\r\n\r\nseq.join(\"-\"); //\"1-2-3\"\r\n\r\nseq.map(a -> a+ 1).distinct().reverse().join()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Concepts\r\n\r\n### Not stream\r\n\r\nFig is different from Stream, and implemented without Stream. While, it is simpler concept -- supplement methods on basic library.\r\n\r\nStream has several characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. Trends to process each element independently\r\n2. Infinite that we can not get the size\r\n3. Designed for large data flow performance\r\n\r\nThus, Stream may not be able to support operations related with the size of it, nor operations involving multiple or even random elements.\r\n\r\nFig targets on \"small data\" operations within application logic, to provide simple & beaufitul code writing about String, List, Map operation & transformation.\r\n\r\n### No utilities\r\n\r\nIn traditional Java way, we use a lot of utilities (StringUtils, FileUtils) for the missing methods in standard library. While in Fig, we make an object oriented and functional way to free you from tedious code.\r\n\r\n### Zero dependency\r\n\r\nFig has no external dependency except JDK 8.\r\n\r\n### Conventions\r\n\r\nFig uses conventions on method names similar with Ruby. If there is a pair of methods `name, name$`, method ends with `$` means calling this method will change the object itself, while calling the other won't.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
